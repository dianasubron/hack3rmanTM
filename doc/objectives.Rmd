# Study Objectives
- Differences between niches
    - There are several different niches in the data set(specific habitats within geographic locations)
    - First question: How do the niches differ? Are the predators/ prey different? Do predator/ prey distributions/ masses vary with location/ temperature/ depth?


- specialists vs. generalists
    - Some predators are generalists, and consume many taxa of prey
    - Others only consume a single species of prey
    - Research Questions: 
        - Are specialists or generalists more successful?
        - Does this change based on the conditions in the niche?
